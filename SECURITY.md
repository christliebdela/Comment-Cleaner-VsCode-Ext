externally. However, we still recommend following these security best practices:

1. Always create backups before processing important files
2. Update to the latest version of Comment Cleaner Pro to benefit from security patches
3. Review the files generated by the extension before committing them to your project
4. Report any suspicious behavior of the extension immediately
