## Current Release

v0.1.6 - Enhanced configuration dialogs and UI improvements

## Overview

Comment Cleaner Pro is a powerful VS Code extension for removing comments from source code files. It helps you streamline your code by efficiently removing all types of comments (line, block, and documentation) across 20+ programming languages while preserving the core functionality of your code.

## The Ironic Truth

> "Yes, this comment remover has comments in its source code. It's like a barber with fabulous hair." 

We believe in documenting our code to help contributors, even while building a tool that removes comments. Our extension removes comments from _production code_, not development code. We're like dentists who eat candy but still brush their teeth! ðŸ˜‰

You could say our source code lives by the motto: _"Do as I say, not as I'm coded."_

3. Search for "Comment Cleaner Pro"
4. Click Install

**Requirements:**
- Visual Studio Code 1.50.0 or higher
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage Guide

### Method 1: Clean Current File
1. Open a source code file in the editor
2. Right-click anywhere in the editor
3. Select "Comment Cleaner Pro: Clean Current File"
4. Choose whether to create a backup
5. The editor will refresh automatically with comments removed

### Method 2: Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Comment Cleaner Pro" 
3. Select "Comment Cleaner Pro: Clean Current File" or "Comment Cleaner Pro: Clean Multiple Files"
4. Follow the prompts to configure options

### Method 3: Activity Bar Integration
1. Click the Comment Cleaner Pro icon in the Activity Bar
2. Choose "Clean Current File" or "Clean Multiple Files"
3. View your recently cleaned files in the "Cleaned Files" section
4. Use Undo/Redo buttons to revert or restore changes as needed

### Batch Processing Options
When cleaning multiple files:
1. Enter a glob pattern to match files (e.g., `*.js`, `src/**/*.py`)
2. Choose whether to create backups
3. Decide if unknown file types should be processed
4. Monitor progress in the notification area

## Command-Line Usage

The extension includes a standalone Python script that can be used directly:

```bash
# Basic usage
python path/to/ccp.py "*.js"

# Process files recursively
python path/to/ccp.py "src/**/*.py" --recursive

# Preserve documentation comments
python path/to/ccp.py "*.java" --keep-doc-comments

# Preserve TODO comments
python path/to/ccp.py "*.cpp" --preserve-todo

# Don't create backups
python path/to/ccp.py "*.html" --no-backup

# Force processing of unknown file types
python path/to/ccp.py "*.custom" --force
```

## Technical Details

Comment Cleaner Pro uses a sophisticated object-oriented architecture with dedicated language handlers to identify and remove comments while preserving code structure. The extension:

- Handles nested comment structures
- Preserves important comments like license headers when configured
- Detects and properly processes character escapes in strings
- Maintains code indentation and whitespace
- Provides accurate line count reduction statistics

## Performance Considerations

- For very large files (10MB+), expect processing to take a few seconds
- Batch processing uses multi-threading for better performance
- Uses memory-efficient processing techniques for large files

## FAQ

### Does Comment Cleaner Pro modify my original files?
Yes, but you can enable backups which create .bak files before processing.

### Can I undo the comment removal?
Yes, you can use the dedicated Undo button in the sidebar, use standard VS Code undo operations, or restore from the .bak backup files if you enabled backups.

### Does it work with all programming languages?
It supports 20+ major languages. For unlisted languages, you can try the "force" option, but results may vary.
